What's the defining prperty of a Binary Search Tree

	for every node in the tree
		items in the left subtree are smaller
		items in the right subtree are larger

Draw an example BST on the board.

			5
		  /   \
		4       8
	  /        / \
	 2        6   9
	           \ 
	             7

How do you find an itme in a Binary Search Tree?
	compare the item to the root
	if smaller, repeat in the left subtree
	if larger, repeat in the right subtree



How do you find the smallest or largest item in a Binary Search Tree?

BST Run-Time

What's the best-case height of a BST with N nodes?
	the tree is balanced 
	the height is O(log N)
	find, insert, and remove are O(log N)
What's the worst -case height of a BST with N nodes?
	the tree is like a linked list
	the height is O(N)
	find, insert, and remove are O(N)

What's the average-case height of a BST with N nodes?
	the average case is 38% worse than the best case
	the height is still O(log N)
	find, insert, and remove are....
