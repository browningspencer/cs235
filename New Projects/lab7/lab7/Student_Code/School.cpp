 *  	A-
 *
 * Compute the GPA by finding the average of all the grades with a matching student ID
 * in the Grade file. The GPA is calculated by taking a Student's total sum GPA and
 * dividing by the number of classes taken. If the given student ID has no matching
 * grades in the Grade file, the GPA is 0.00. It is not necessary to store the course
 * names so long as the total number of courses taken is counted.
 *
 * You may assume that the given student ID exists in the map or set.
 *
 * Use the following point values for each grade.
 *
 *		  A = 4.0  A- = 3.7
 *	B+ = 3.4  B = 3.0  B- = 2.7
 *	C+ = 2.4  C = 2.0  C- = 1.7
 *	D+ = 1.4  D = 1.0  D- = 0.7
 *		  E = 0.0
 *
 * Returns false if an invalid filename is given, otherwise true.
