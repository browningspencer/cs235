 *
 *	Robot: Shockwave Punch
 *	Adds bonus damage to the Robot's next attack (and only its next attack) equal to (strength  * ((current_energy/maximum_energy)^4)).
 *	Can only be used if the Robot has at least [ROBOT_ABILITY_COST] energy.
 *	Decreases the Robot's current energy by [ROBOT_ABILITY_COST] (after calculating the additional damage) when used.
 *		Examples:
 *		strength=20, current_energy=20, maximum_energy=20		=> bonus_damage=20
 *		strength=20, current_energy=15, maximum_energy=20		=> bonus_damage=6
 *		strength=20, current_energy=10, maximum_energy=20		=> bonus_damage=1
 *		strength=20, current_energy=5,  maximum_energy=20		=> bonus_damage=0
 *	Robot Note:
 *	The bonus damage formula should be computed using double arithmetic, and only
 *	the final result should be cast into an integer.
 *
 *	Return true if the ability was used; false otherwise.
